Goals
-----
Easy to make diagram without using the mouse (mouse can still be used)
 - a similar functionality to vimium plugin 
Easy to notice different blocks 
 - later on i should make them customizable(colors, block image)
Mouse purpose should be to navigate the blocks


Layout
--------
◘ Module: a module can contain input, output or both. Should offer similar functionality like matlab simulink
 - modules can be nested in a module
 - contain blocks
 
◘ Block: can be square, triangle, the usual shapes of UML ( i might not add all)
